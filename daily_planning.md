- [x] Add static shapes in the space to test collision with the ball
- [x] Move constants to a different file
- [x] Change gravity with arrow keys
- [x] Have clarity on [when to use Entities](https://taintedcoders.com/bevy/entities/)
- [x] Add bevy inspector
- [x] Understand Events in Bevy [(EventWriter and EventReader)](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/programming/events.html)
