Daily planner for the continuation of the project:

- [x] Make a daily planner
- [x] Add boundaries for the ball (screen)
- [x] Reposition ball on mouse-click position
- [x] Add new ball with keyboard key A at random position
        Balls added this way are deleted on contact with window border
- [x] Add gravity for making all balls fall
- [x] Add static shapes in the space to test collision with the ball
- [x] Move constants to a different file
- [x] Change gravity with arrow keys
- [x] Have clarity on [when to use Entities](https://taintedcoders.com/bevy/entities/)
- [x] Add bevy inspector
- [x] Understand Events in Bevy [(EventWriter and EventReader)](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/programming/events.html)
- [x] Switch to absolute position on screen (instead of window) of the ball
- [x] Function to convert [from window to world coordinates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64714076/how-do-i-convert-screen-space-to-world-space-coords-in-bevy-using-camera2dcompon)
- [-] ~~Control ball with keyboard arrow keys~~ (WASD + key to turn off gravity)
- [ ] Test collisions with Triangles and Squares [(add collisions)](https://kishimotostudios.com/articles/aabb_collision/)
- [ ] Check out Tiled level editor
- [ ] Get started working on the player (his file, structs, functions, sprites, ...)
- [ ] On [using bundles](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/programming/bundle.html)
- [ ] Test out some particle systems
- [ ] Make a navigation for the app
- [ ] Get started on some UI elements (possibly reusables) 
- [ ] Learn how to [add bloom to shapes](https://bevyengine.org/examples/2d-rendering/bloom-2d/)
